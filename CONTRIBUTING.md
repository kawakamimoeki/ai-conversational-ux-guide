# Contributing to Conversational UX Guide

The goal of the Conversational UX Guide Working Group is to collect, document, and publish best practices for AI Native application. To make them easy to understand, evaluate, and apply, we encode them in a specific structure.

We welcome your participation, whether you make small or large contributions, for this working group to actively operate.

## How to Contribute

Please consider contributing to Conversational UX Guide. Below are suggestions on how you can contribute.

- Share opinions and encourage discussion:
  Fresh perspectives, interesting thoughts, or early novel ideas can provoke discussions and produce unpredictable outcomes. Please create Issues to share your opinions on AI Native application-related topics anytime.
- Read existing patterns and improve them:
  We recommend starting by reading the existing patterns and materials in this repository. Did you find a confusing phrase or poor grammar? A content error? Create a GitHub Issue or propose a correction directly as a pull request.
- Verify the use of patterns:
  Confirming that multiple organizations are using a pattern increases its relevance and informs other adopters that the pattern is proven. If you are using any of the published patterns, list your organization as a known instance of that pattern and describe your experience in applying it.
- Translate existing patterns:
  When introducing AI Native application practices in your region, the language barrier can be an issue for people, as most AI Native application content is available in English. Therefore, it is highly valuable to help people in your region/organization understand AI Native application in their language. For guidance on translating patterns into other languages, please refer to the translation instructions.
- Review open pull requests:
  Even if you don't know all the details of the Patterns Working Group, feedback on existing pull requests (especially those proposing changes to pattern content) is beneficial for their authors.
  As someone learning AI Native application, you can offer your opinion from the perspective of a future reader. As someone with your own AI Native application experience, you can share your experiences with the author.
- Contribute to new patterns:
  A major contribution you can make is documenting the best practices of AI Native application you have experienced or know about.
  This repository's content has defined maturity levels. First-time contributors should aim for Maturity Level 1: Initial (unstructured experience reports or patterns with missing parts) and 2: Structured (best practices following the pattern format and basic textual representation rules).
- Become a pattern advocate: By bringing in more people with their perspectives and experiences, patterns become better, and more topics get covered. Has a colleague told you about a novel AI Native application best practice? Invite them to contribute to this repository!

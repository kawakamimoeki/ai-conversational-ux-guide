# Contribution to the Conversational UX Guide

The goal of the AI Conversational UX Guide is to collect and document best practices for applications using conversational UX, and make them publicly available.
To ensure this organization remains active, we welcome your participation, from small to large contributions.

## How to Contribute

Consider contributing to the AI Conversational UX Guide. Here are some proposals on how you can contribute:

- Share your thoughts and encourage discussion:
  Fresh perspectives, interesting ideas, or even early innovative ideas can spark discussions and lead to unexpected outcomes. Feel free to share your opinions at any time on topics related to conversational UX applications by creating Issues.
- Read and improve existing patterns:
  We recommend starting by reading existing patterns or materials in this repository. Did you find any confusing phrases or bad grammar? Are there errors in the content? Create an issue or propose direct corrections as pull requests.
- Confirm the use of patterns:
  By confirming that multiple organizations are using a pattern, its relevance increases, and other adopters can be informed that the pattern has been proven. If you are using any of the publicly available patterns, list your organization as a known instance of that pattern and describe your experience applying it.
- Translate existing patterns:
  If you are introducing conversational UX applications in your region, language barriers may be a problem. Therefore, making sure that people in your region/organization can understand conversational UX in their native language is very valuable. For guidance on translating patterns into other languages, please refer to the translation instructions.
- Review open pull requests:
  Feedback on existing pull requests is helpful to their creators. As someone with experience in conversational UX, you can share your experience with the author.

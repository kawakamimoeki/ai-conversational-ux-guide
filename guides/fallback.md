# Fallback

As mentioned in [Conversational UX Issues](/guides/issues.md), it is quite difficult to guess user input patterns, so if your application cannot handle it, you need to fall back to another application or process.

Here is an example of this fallback.

## Directing users to another existing application

Here is an example of ChatGPT. Here we do not pass on the full functionality, but only a guiding message.

```
Q. Tell me what the weather is like today.
A. I cannot provide real-time weather information, but to check the latest weather forecast, we recommend you use a weather website or application, or search for "today's weather" on a search engine.
```

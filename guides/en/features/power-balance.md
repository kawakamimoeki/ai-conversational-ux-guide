# Power Balance

The UX of an application can suffer if an assistant works too much or too little. It is especially important to be cautious when everything is done automatically.

This is because the assistant's behavior is not always perfect, so users may need to make corrections.

Please provide an environment where users and assistants can communicate with each other.

For example, making documents output by the assistant editable, or allowing users to undo the assistant's execution results up to a certain point would be helpful.

# Transparency in the Process

Transparency in the process of how an assistant arrives at a result is important. By ensuring transparency, for example:

- The user can trust the results
- The user can learn from the assistant's process
- The user can use hints to modify the assistant's results

For instance, when providing a response that meets the user's request from multiple documents, it is necessary to present the parts of the documents that form the basis of the response.

Similarly, when an assistant performs operations that can be represented in a GUI, the process of the GUI movement should be displayed.

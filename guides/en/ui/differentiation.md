# Differentiating from conventional UI

The first impression of the user interface (UI) is crucial to users. Users predict the functionality of a UI based on their experience of operating similar UIs they have encountered before.

Based on this, what should be avoided is adopting UIs such as chatbots that respond with conventional phrases or search windows, which may cause users to misunderstand the AI-based conversational UX functionality.

Let's differentiate from conventional UIs, for example, by:

- Using special icons for visuals
- Avoiding placing them in the corner of the screen (often a common pattern for chatbots)

and so on.

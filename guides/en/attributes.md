# Conversational UX characteristics

## Natural language input

An application with a conversational UX should expect any natural language message (prompt) as input from the user.

Validation at the point of user input can be difficult.
This is due to the fact that there are countless patterns of natural language messages. Unlike traditional application input, these inputs are not words or keywords, nor are they selective.

Also, whether the application can process the input cannot be known until the language model actually interprets the prompt.

Thus, the patterns of user input in a conversational UX are almost infinite.

## Learning about the user's application

Users have more limited opportunities to learn how to interact with applications in a conversational UX than in a traditional one. This is because the basic structure of the UI consists only of prompt input fields, limiting the use of buttons and menus as in the past.

In addition, users are unfamiliar with this experience, as conversational UX has not been around long enough. This means that without more careful learning, users could get lost.

Bing AI presents the prompt suggestions immediately after one previous Assistant message. This is one means of assisting the user in how to use the application.

We will discuss these learning aids later, but for now, we will only mention that the user has not had much opportunity to learn about the application and is not yet fully familiar with it.

## User Expectations of AI

Users may not yet fully understand the properties of the language model. Applications that place language models at the center of their processing systems may not have a clear idea of what is possible and what is not, and in the worst case, users may overestimate the capabilities of language models. For example, it is quite possible that the user may have an illusion of full understanding of human language and intent and the ability to fully understand and realize instructions, or the illusion of full understanding of real-time real-world situations.

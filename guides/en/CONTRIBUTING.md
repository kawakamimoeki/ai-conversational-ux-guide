# Contribution to Conversational UX Guide

The goal of the AI Conversational UX Guide is to collect and document best practices for applications using conversational UX, and to make them publicly available. To facilitate understanding, evaluation, and application, they will be encoded in a specific structure.

To make this organization active, we are waiting for your participation, from small to big contributions.

## Ways to Contribute

Consider contributing to the AI Conversational UX Guide. Here are some suggestions on how you can contribute:

- Share your opinions and spark discussions:
  Fresh perspectives, interesting thoughts, or initial innovative ideas can stimulate discussions and lead to unpredictable results. You can share your opinions on topics related to conversational UX applications by creating an issue at any time.
- Read and improve existing patterns:
  It is recommended to start by reading the existing patterns and materials in this repository. Did you find any confusing phrases or bad grammar? Is there an error in the content? Create a GitHub issue or propose a direct fix as a pull request.
- Confirm the use of patterns:
  By confirming that multiple organizations are using a pattern, you can increase its relevance and let other adopters know that it has been proven. If you are using any of the publicly available patterns, list your organization as a known instance of that pattern and describe your experience applying it.
- Translate existing patterns:
  When introducing conversational UX applications in your region, language barriers can become a problem. Therefore, it is very valuable to make sure that people in your region/organization can understand conversational UX in their native language. See the translation guidelines for translating patterns into other languages.
- Review open pull requests:
  Feedback on existing pull requests (especially those proposing changes to pattern content) is beneficial to the creator, even if you do not know the details of the pattern working group. As a learner of conversational UX, you can express your opinion from the perspective of future readers. As someone with experience in conversational UX, you can share your experience with the author.

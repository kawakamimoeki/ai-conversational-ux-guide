# Adopt a conversational UX

When a new technology comes along, developers react in two ways:

1. That function we have always wanted to do can be achieved with this technology.
2. We want to make something using this technology.

First, let's discuss the first of these.

## Realize the function you dreamed of

In this case, it is first necessary to compare the complete specification with the limitations of the language model and find a compromise at this point.

The language model is not a universal AI at this time, and not every feature is feasible.
Also, it is difficult to maximize the functionality of language models while the knowledge and know-how to handle them has not yet permeated the organization.

It is important to start small, narrowing down the scope to what is feasible for your organization at this point.
Try building a working prototype first, and you may find that the functionality you had in mind is not so useful.

## Get Inspired

The latter can be expressed as coming up with ideas for features from new technology.
In this case, we first need to switch from a technology-to-feature perspective to a user-to-feature perspective to discuss the usefulness of the feature.

I would not necessarily say that the marketing perspective that prompt-type UI is in vogue and therefore might be attractive to users is necessarily a bad thing, though,
Whether users will use a product in the long term depends on whether a feature is easy for them to use, so a balance between marketing and usability is necessary for the long-term benefit of the product.

When thinking about how to combine a conversational UX with your application, it is important to consider the inherent value of the application.

For example, if the application is designed to help users find the products they really need, we should examine what role the conversational UX can play in helping them find the best products.

Also, take a fresh look at the challenges users have faced in the past and see if any of those challenges can be improved with a conversational UX.

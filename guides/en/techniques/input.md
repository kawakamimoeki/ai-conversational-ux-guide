# Input UI

The input UI is at the center of the conversational user experience.
When designing the input UI, please consider the following:

- Is the input field size appropriate for the expected length of the prompt?
- Does the input field support multiple lines? (Or should it?)
- Are the key bindings appropriate?
- Does the placeholder provide users with the information they should enter?
- Is there a send button? (Essential for mobile devices)
- Are there any marks or indicators that immediately convey that this input field is a prompt for AI?

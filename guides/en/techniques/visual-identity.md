# Visual identity

To build a relationship between the user and the assistant, consider using a unique visual identity for the assistant.

For example, if the conversation UX with the assistant is scattered throughout the application, the assistant can maintain its presence without being buried in other UI elements. This can increase the likelihood that users will use the assistant.

Additionally, the effectiveness of visual identity can be recognized from the perspective of the mere-exposure effect. The mere-exposure effect is a psychological phenomenon in which repeated exposure to something or someone initially disinteresting can eventually generate interest. If the assistant has no visual identity, the user will only interact with it when exchanging messages. However, by placing the assistant's visual identity, for example, next to the prompt input field, the number of interactions can be significantly increased.

Visual identity doesn't necessarily have to be concrete. Even if the visual identity is abstract, users can feel the assistant's presence through conversation.

In addition, AI visuals commonly utilize "emitting bodies". By conforming to these patterns, it is possible to reduce the user's learning costs.

Below are some examples of assistant visual identities:

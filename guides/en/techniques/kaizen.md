A system where feedback is sent to the operator or data is supplemented when user prompts cannot be processed is a
good way to reduce user distrust.

For example, if the prompt could not be processed, it might be nice to reply with a message like this

## Improve functionality

It can be quite difficult to cover the true needs of users from the beginning.

- "This prompt didn't work for me, but this one seems to work."

## Complementing Data

It is also possible that the user experience is being compromised by a lack of data.
Conversational UX may require different data content and data structures than traditional applications. Always consider adapting to conversational UX.

# Unrestricted Context

There are chatbot applications created using GPT that allow users to ask questions without any limitations on the context of their inquiries.

- [Chatbase | ChatGPT for your website](https://www.chatbase.co/)

However, despite their usefulness, such chatbots have not gained significant popularity. Examples of limited-context chatbot applications include ChatPDF, which allows users to create chatbots from PDFs, and Chatbase, which enables users to create chatbots from websites and files.

Conversely, using ChatGPT for natural language processing has proven to be very useful. The experience with ChatGPT is designed to allow for any type of inquiry, regardless of context, although it often generates nonsensical responses. Nevertheless, its low barriers to entry make it an excellent resource for users seeking answers to various questions.

The reason that a chatbot with limited context may not provide a great user experience is that the context of a conversation can change frequently during the course of a dialogue. For example, imagine asking a senior colleague at work a question that may require multiple levels of context.

```
Q: What is this error that I am seeing?
A: It is happening during the after(:suite) test.
Q: What is after(:suite)?
A: It's a feature that allows you to do X, Y, and Z.
Q: Oh, I see. How can I fix it?
A: Well, in our development environment, we have a unique workflow called X that might be causing the problem.
Q: Thank you for your help!
```

In this conversation, the context shifted from a library-related issue to an organization-specific problem. This kind of context switching happens frequently in conversations, and ChatGPT's vast knowledge allows it to handle it seamlessly.

Although limited-context chatbots, such as those mentioned above, also use ChatGPT as their foundation and can answer questions without any problems, their design limits the user experience to a specific context (e.g., a PDF or web page).

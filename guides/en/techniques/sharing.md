# Allow users to share their usage with each other

When dealing with only one user, it is impossible to prevent users from ending up misunderstanding how to use the system, so it would be good to have a system that allows users to share their knowledge with other users.

For example, there could be a platform to share the content of prompts and a series of interactions between the user and the assistant, or the user could listen to other users' requests and come up with prompts on their behalf.

## Sharing within a team

When the same team is using a product, it is best to assume that the degree of mastery in creating prompts will vary among individuals. Therefore, it is important to design the product so that you can share your know-how with each other as a team.

However, not everyone on the team will have the same goal in mind when using the product, so it would be better to have a feature that helps them create prompts or collaborate on the use of the product.

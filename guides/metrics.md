## General UX metrics

## Task Success Rate

Tasks in this context are the individual steps that users take to achieve their goals in a product.
Users will give up on a goal if they distrust the product or find it too complicated to operate before achieving it.

## Time-on-Task (time to perform a task)

The time it takes to accomplish a goal is influenced by how few operations are required to accomplish it, or how easy it is to understand the operation, etc.

## Search vs Navigation (Search/Navigation Ratio)

Users are not happy when they have to navigate through a product one by one to get the information they need, but when that information falls out of the sky on its own.
Search forces users to make an effort to search for information, so reduce it as much as possible, and instead use navigation, i.e., menus and suggestions to guide users.

## System Usability Scale

Although it is only a subjective perspective, asking users directly about their impressions of a product is one way to get hints for product improvement.

## Customer Satisfaction

Asking questions about how users feel will help improve their impression of the product.
This could be a way to promote the "Don't be evil" policy. This is part of Google's Code of Business Conduct,
It implies that in the long run, a company that does good for the world, even at the cost of some short-term profit, will do better as a shareholder and in every other way.
